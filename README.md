# Session 3: USAS-based Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

This tutorial provides an introduction to using the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) for sentiment analysis. The focus is on the emotion semantic tags, specifically the Emotional Actions, States, and Processes General category. USAS contains 22 sentiment categories. The semantic tags often contain one or more ‘pluses’ or ‘minuses’ to indicate a positive or negative sentiment, and this tutorial demonstrates how to leverage these signs for sentiment classification.


## Google Colaboratory
To ensure you can make the most of the tutorial, it is crucial that you familiarize yourself with Google Colaboratory and Google Drive.

Our session will involve:
 - **Running Code in Google Colaboratory:** This is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google, which allows you to write and execute Python code 
   through your browser.
 - **Setting File Paths in Google Colaboratory:** You will need to know how to navigate and manage file paths within this environment.
 - **Mounting Google Drive in Google Colaboratory:** This will enable you to upload datasets from your Google Drive and save outputs directly to it.

To help you get started, we recommend reviewing the following [Google Colab Tutorial](https://github.com/dml2611/google-colab-tutorial).


## Conclusion

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) for sentiment analysis. You will learn how to effectively utilize the emotion semantic tags provided by USAS to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, you will gain the skills needed to build your own sentiment classifiers, both using traditional methods and advanced deep learning techniques, thereby enabling you to perform detailed sentiment analysis on various text data.
